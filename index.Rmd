This is a sample document, including some of the default Rmd content to illustrate display of the page on a `gh-pages` website until we post actual content related to the Practical Machine Learning course project in December 2015. 

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
